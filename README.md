# fake-audio-detector

Simple fake audio detector made for [CVPR 2022 - Workshop on Media Forensics](https://sites.google.com/view/mediaforensics2022/).

## Requirements

Install Python3.9.12+ and the related dependencies using:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the `main.py` file giving as input the path of the audio that you want to check through the trained model ADC.

Example:

```bash
python3 main.py "data/sample.wav"
```

The result will be `The sample audio is fake` or `The sample audio is real`.
Feel free to re-use the feature extraction script, if you have any issues or questions about this script [open an issue](https://github.com/UNICT-Fake-Audio/fake-audio-detector/issues/new).
